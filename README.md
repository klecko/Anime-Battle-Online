# Anime-Battle-Online
A multiplayer game based in python, created by a team of three bored guys.

You have two main files: the server and the client. You will need python 3 in order to run them. Server main options, such as IP, Port or Maximum Players, can be configured in the first lines. 
This game was made by three 16 years old, so don't expect optimization or something like that. We created this game to have some fun, and we stopped developping it when we got tired. When we stopped, PowerUps were being introduced, so there are some lines about them in the server file. You will find them if you look for the word UNFINISHED. I hope you have fun.
