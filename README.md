A multiplayer game based in python, created by a team of three bored guys.

As a multiplayer game, it is divided in server and client. You will need python 3 in order to run them. 
This game was made by three 16 years old, so don't expect optimization, documentation or something like that. We created this game to have some fun, and we stopped developping it when we got tired. I hope you have fun.

KleSoft, Kyntasia and Cervigamer.
