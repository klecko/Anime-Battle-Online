# Anime-Battle-Online
A multiplayer game based in python, created by a team of three bored guys.

As a multiplayer game, it is divided in server and client. You will need python 3 in order to run them. 
This game was made by three 16 years old, so don't expect optimization, documentation or something like that. We created this game to have some fun, and we stopped developping it when we got tired. When we stopped, PowerUps were being introduced, so there are some lines about them in the server file. You will find them if you look for the word UNFINISHED. I hope you have fun.
